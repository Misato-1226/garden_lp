              Parking can get quite busy, so we recommend taking public transit,
              walking, or biking. Weâ€™re located on the #17 Oak bus route and a
              15-minute walk from the Oakridge Canada Line station. Parking is
              free in our lot off West 37th avenue but spaces are limited. Free
              street parking is also available in the surrounding area (where
              street signs permit). Please respect our neighbourhood and
              driveways of our neighbours.
